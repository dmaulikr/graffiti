## [See this project on Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/graffiti-l3v85w)
An augmented reality application that allows you to leave virtual graffiti at specific places.

Graffiti uses your GPS location as well as magnetic heading and accelerometer data to accurately place graffiti in your environment. When another user comes across your artwork, it appears on their screen just as you left it. Graffiti also uses your camera so that your virtual "tag" is placed in context and enhances reality.
